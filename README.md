# Greed 

I set velocity to direction and gave it a y value. 
I changed the artifacts class to rocks. 
then changed message to points then created variables with score points and then added points to points. 
I set the range for the player to 585 on the y axis and restricted on the x axis. 
I had director keep track of score and relocate gems and rocks to a new spot.
